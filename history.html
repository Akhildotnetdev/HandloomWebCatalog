            <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            <img src="images/l-10.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The word "Handloom" derives its meaning from the process of operation of a country wooden structure called "loom" by hand and with the sole aid of manpower.
                Even today, despite the fact that our cloth markets are flooded with heaps of fabrics, both printed and woven synthetic ones in eye-catching designs and bewitching colours which often stole perennial attraction to the young and ageing girls and women, still it is the handloom which in the ultimate analysis provides answer to the aspirations and desires of our women folk for the simple reason that the machine has not yet been devised by man which can out do the handloom in production of butis, tie-ups and other designs which come naturally in weaving together with the zari work in the borders and in the bodice of the saree. Hence the importance of the handloom in this atomic age.</p>
            <p>
                Pochampally silk saree manufacturing history goes back to 1970, when it was decided by some village headmen of Pochampally to weave silk along with cotton(cotton weaving was being done since very long back), to make a better living. They have sent two young weavers to learn the secrets of the art to Bangalore. This was the beginning of a revolutionary era in the Pochampally handloom industry, which led to the eventual dominance of the Indian tie die patola Industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                The genesis of the decision to enter into new realms of weaving(silk), can be attributed to a new era, in the history of POCHAMPALLY IKAT. Its merchandise is a handicraft on which about a thirty thousand families depend on traditionally. The industry is second only to agriculture.
            </p>
            <p>Pochampally products are handcrafted to perfection by skilled artisans who are endowed with critical skills in intricate designs, having decades of experience behind them in their respective fields. In certain cases these masterpieces can take upto one hundred and twenty days to take final shape, to the satisfaction of our craftsmen. </p>

            <p>Till now, you as a customer had to pay a lot of overheads, viz. profit margins (of wholesaler, retailer chain), stocking expenses etc., It was all inefficient and at the end of it your buying price definitely got inflated.
