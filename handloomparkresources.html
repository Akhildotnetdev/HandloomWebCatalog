            <p>The feel of hand-woven fabric, its texture, the weft and the warp, the intricacy of design; the symmetry and also the idiosyncrasies of made-by-hand weave are unique.

            One can find all this and more at the Pochampally-Ikkat Art Mela that unfolded at Sri Raghurama Vedika in Mohan Das complex on Bandar Road in Patamata on Tuesday.

            Upcoming Telugu film actor Neha Deshpande inaugurated the week-long event which will be on till August 9.

            The uniqueness of Pochampally material is in the transfer of design and colour onto warp and weft threads first and then weave them together, explain stall-holders at the venue which is awash with bright colours.

            As you walk along the row of stalls, you can’t help but admire the centuries old craft traditions that are passed on from one generation of artisans to the next.

            Speaking at the inaugural function, Ms. Neha of ‘Dil Deevana’ movie fame, said the wide range of apparel, particularly the designer fabric, the silks and the cotton saris were huge bait for women who had weakness of handlooms.

            Platforms like these are created by the government to generate a win-win situation, both for the skilled artistes and the buyers.

            The immensely talented artistes find market for their products while buyers can have the satisfaction of taking home the products paying their original price,” she said. “Handlooms are part of Indian culture and tradition. By promoting these hand-woven products, we would be helping the artistes a great deal. It also means promoting their innate skills and creativity,” said Lava Kumar, Director of Pochampally Handloom Park.

            Besides exclusive handloom products like handmade bed and home linen, dress materials, silk and cotton saris in exquisite designs and contemporary colours, the expo also offers stoles, scarves and saris in silk and cotton, duppatas, table mats, table covers, cotton shirts, kurtis and hand bags.
            </p>
            <p>The expo will be open to public from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on all days.</p>
