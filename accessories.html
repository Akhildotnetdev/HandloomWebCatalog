Each region of India has its own textile tradition and known for the production of distinct varieties of material. Khana material is always produced by keeping definite width and length. Women in north Karnataka and some parts of Marathwada and Vidharbha regions in Maharashtra use this Guledagudd Khana.
            </p>
            <p>    The art of ornamenting handloom fabrics in India is an age-old traditional technique and custom from time immemorial. Although, India abounds with numerous types of costumes for women, saris and blouse have assumed a special importance and significance. Nothing identifies a woman as being Indian as strongly as the saris do. It is worn in many traditional styles. The Indian women attach greater value of sentiment to the sari and blouse. The Indian traditional handloom sari and blouse regains supreme among the beautiful costumes of the world. Its origin is lost in antiquity. The ancient famous Indian temples give us an account of the varieties of dress as well as styles of weaving and wearing. The saris and blouse is the one common garment of Indian women since ages.
</p>
                <p>History is the result of various forces and factors including geographical, social, religious etc. Each region of India evolved its own textile tradition and known for the production of distinct varieties of handloom saris.

It employs a large number of women folk and thrives on inherited skills and patronage by rural population and connoisseurs of art.
</p>
    <p>            Handloom industry occupies a prominent place in decentralized industrial sector of India. Handloom is the largest unorganized economic activity in India, next to agriculture.

                Many clusters of Karnataka state is also home to traditional designs and intricate weaving methods. The more traditional saris of Karnataka are the Molkalmuru saris of Chitradurgaand and the Ilkal saris of Bagalkot. Weaving is supposed to have come to Ilkal around the 8th century AD and the sheer rustic look of the textile keeps it still popular. The traditional Guledgudd Khana (Choli or Blouse, elsewhere called Khana), which is only one traditional cluster making blouse fabric in India. It compliments to Ilkal saris as this combination is widely used, not only in the northern part of Karnataka but also in the Marathawada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra. While the aged ladies wear the Ilkal Saris and Guledgudd Khana in their traditional Maharashtrian style, the younger generations wear it in their modern fashionable style. As a result Ilkal Saris and Guledgudd Khana in their best combinations are used extensively in Urban and Rural parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra.
                Be it a marriage or any big or celebration or ceremony, the combination of Ilkal Saris and Guledgudd Khana are widely used. This combination has been the treasure of beautiful, dignified, ultra-modern fashions of sixteen years old dream girls and that of sixty year old traditional dressed housewives too.</p></div>
